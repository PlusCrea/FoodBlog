{"id":"22","title":"Chocolate cupcakes","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"Makes 12","time":"Hands-on time 20 min, oven time 25-30 min","description":"These indulgent chocolate cupcakes use the all-in-one method so they’re a breeze to make. Top with generous, thick swirls of the chocolate ganache and serve to family and friends. They’re guaranteed to put smiles on faces","ingredients":["160g unsalted butter, softened","160g golden caster sugar","3 medium free-range eggs, beaten","160g self-raising flour","2 tsp vanilla bean paste or extract","40g dark cocoa powder (we used Green & Black’s)","3 tbsp milk","100g dark chocolate, roughly chopped","150ml double cream, at room temperature","12-hole muffin tin; 12 cupcake paper muffin cases (we used Dr Oetker)"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Heat the oven to 170C/150C fan/gas 3 1/2. Put all the cake ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Using an electric hand mixer, beat everything together to make a thick, smooth batter (this will take about 5 minutes)."},{"Step 2":"Line the muffin tin with paper cases and divide the batter equally among them. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the cake is well risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean."},{"Step 3":"For the ganache, put the chocolate in a microwaveable bowl, cover with cling film then heat on the lowest setting for a minute at a time, stirring after each minute until melted. Let stand for 5 minutes then use a balloon whisk to slowly beat in the cream a little at a time. When a thick glossy ganache forms, use a small palette knife to spread the ganache onto the cupcakes. Chill in the fridge (cover once the ganache has set) or leave at room temperature if you are eating straightaway. They are best eaten at room temp, so take them out of the fridge an hour before eating."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/cakes_api/22.jpg"}
