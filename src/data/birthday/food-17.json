In a food processor, pulse together the butter, thyme and sugar with a pinch of salt until the mixture is creamy. Add the flour and pulse again until it just comes together to form a dough. If you don’t have a food processor, beat the ingredients in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer until creamy, then quickly beat in the flour."},{"Step 2":"Press the dough into the lined cake tin, then chill for 30 minutes until very cold. Prick the base all over with a fork, then bake for 20-25 minutes until golden and dry."},{"Step 3":"Mix the topping ingredients (don’t over-whisk), then immediately pour over the baked base. Return to the oven for another 20-25 minutes until just set, then leave to cool in the tin. Dust with icing sugar and scatter with edible flowers, if you like. Cut into squares or rectangles to serve."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/cakes_api/17.jpg"}
