{"id":"28","title":"Toffee ice-cream cake","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"Serves 10","time":"Ready in less than 30 minutes","description":"","ingredients":["100g golden syrup","100g caster sugar","1 tsp bicarbonate of soda","600g tub good-quality vanilla ice cream","200g raspberries","2 x 300g Madeira cakes (we used Waitrose)","100g dulce de leche"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Lightly oil a medium baking tray. To make the honeycomb, add 100g golden syrup to a saucepan with 100g caster sugar. Heat gently until the sugar has dissolved, then increase the heat and bubble until the syrup thickens and turns a dark golden caramel colour. Whisk 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda into the caramel, then pour the mixture into the baking tray. Leave to cool and set, then break the honeycomb into pieces."},{"Step 2":"Soften a 600g tub good-quality vanilla ice cream. Fold through half the honeycomb and 200g raspberries (keep the remaining honeycomb in an airtight container). Thinly slice 2 x 300g Madeira cakes (we used Waitrose) and spread 100g dulce de leche thinly over all the slices (on one side only)."},{"Step 3":"Use one-third of the slices, spread-side up, overlapping slightly to cover the base of a 1.6 litre loaf tin lined with cling film (with plenty overhanging). Spoon over half the hokey pokey ice cream, smoothing with the back of a spoon. Repeat the layers, finishing with the remaining slices of Madeira cake, spread-side down. Cover tightly with the cling film and pop the tin in the freezer until it has refrozen."},{"Step 4":"To serve, pull back the cling film and invert the ice-cream cake onto a serving plate. Carefully peel off the cling film. Sprinkle with some of the leftover honeycomb and slice thickly to serve."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/cakes_api/28.jpg"}
