{"id":"55","title":"Charred corn and chicken tacos","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"Serves 4","time":"Hands-on time 30 min","description":"Lightly charred summer sweetcorn is the star of this quick chicken taco recipe. We love the smoky flavour when cooked on a barbecue but the recipe works just as well on a griddle pan too.","ingredients":["4 tbsp olive oil","¼ tsp sweet smoked paprika","1 tbsp chipotle sauce (we used Tabasco chipotle sauce)","3 limes","3 tbsp good quality mayonnaise","2 sweetcorn cobs in their husks","8 small or 4 large, soft corn tortillas","2 ripe avocados, sliced","2 cooked free-range chicken breasts, sliced (see Next Time)","4 spring onions, sliced","150g cherry tomatoes, halved","Handful fresh coriander leaves"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Light a barbecue or heat a griddle pan to high. In a small bowl, mix the oil, paprika, chipotle sauce and the finely grated zest and juice of 1½ limes. Transfer 2 tbsp to a separate bowl and mix with the mayo to make a dressing.Set aside."},{"Step 2":"When the barbecue coals are glowing white or the griddle pan is hot, peel back the husks from the corn, cut off or tie back with string, then brush each cob with some chipotle and lime mixture. Cook, turning and basting with the rest of the chipotle and lime mixture, until beginning to char on all sides (10-15 minutes). Once cool enough to handle, hold each cob vertically on a secure chopping board and carefully slice down the sides with a sharp knife to remove the kernels."},{"Step 3":"Warm the tortillas on the barbecue or in the griddle pan for 1-2 minutes. Top with avocado, chicken (or see Next Time), spring onions, tomatoes, charred corn, a spoonful of dressing and a few coriander leaves. Serve with the remaining limes, cut into wedges, for squeezing."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/mexican_api/55.jpg"}
