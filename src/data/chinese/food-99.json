{"id":"99","title":"Duck with spiced plums","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"Serves 4","time":"Takes 10 minutes to make, 25 minutes to cook","description":"This is a hearty, fruity yet amazingly low-cal Chinese-inspired duck recipe that makes use of seasonal plums. Extra zing comes from ginger, star anise and red chilli.","ingredients":["6 ripe red plums (we like victoria)","2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely sliced into matchsticks","1 star anise","1 red chilli, deseeded and finely sliced","2 tbsp soft light brown sugar","Grated zest and juice of 1 lime","4 duck breasts, skin on","2 tsp Chinese five-spice powder"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Halve the plums, remove the stones and cut into wedges. Place in a small saucepan with the ginger, star anise, chilli, sugar, and the lime zest and juice. Heat over a low heat to dissolve the sugar, then turn the heat up a little, cover and cook for 10-15 minutes until the plums are tender. Set aside and keep warm."},{"Step 2":"Preheat the oven to 180ºC/fan160ºC/gas 4. Slash the skin of the duck breasts with a sharp knife in a crisscross pattern, then sprinkle with the five-spice and some sea salt."},{"Step 3":"Heat a heavy ovenproof frying pan over a medium-high heat. Place the duck in the pan, skin-side down, and cook for 5-6 minutes until the skin is golden and crisp. Tip most of the fat from the pan, then turn the duck over and sear the other side for 1 minute. Put the pan in the oven and cook for 6-8 minutes, depending on the size of the duck breasts (we think they’re best served pink)."},{"Step 4":"Remove the duck to a warm plate and rest for 5 minutes. Slice the duck breasts and serve with the spiced plums and some wilted greens and potatoes, if you like."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/chinese_recipes_api/99.jpg"}
