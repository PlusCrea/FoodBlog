The meat is marinated in black pepper and char siu barbecue sauce, then wrapped in puff pastry, topped with sesame seeds and baked. The final flavour and texture are superb.","ingredients":["\u0007300g venison leg or shoulder, trimmed and cut into 0.5cm pieces","½ tbsp caster sugar","¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper","Pinch white pepper","90ml vegetable oil","\u0007½ small onion, very finely chopped","3½ tbsp vegetable oil","1 shallot, finely sliced into rings","Olive oil for frying","Knob of butter","½ small onion, finely chopped","40g ginger, finely chopped","1 large shallot, finely chopped","6 spring onions, finely chopped","½ tbsp light soy sauce","½ tbsp dark soy sauce","4 tbsp oyster sauce","115g caster sugar","25g cornflour","25g potato starch","325g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting","30g unsweetened custard powder (see tips)","15g caster sugar","3½ tbsp vegetable oil","315g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting","250g salted butter at room temperature (but not soft)","\u0007250g unsalted butter at room temperature (but not soft)","½ tsp vanilla essence","2 medium free-range egg yolks","75ml golden syrup","1-2 tbsp sesame seeds","8cm plain or fluted round pastry cutter"],"method":[{"Step 1":"For the shallot oil, heat the 3½ tbsp vegetable oil in a wok or a saucepan over a low-medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 5-6 minutes until golden. Strain through a sieve into a jug, discarding the shallot (or see Chef Tong’s tips, below), then set aside to cool."},{"Step 2":"Put the venison in a bowl with the sugar, 1 tbsp of the shallot oil, the black pepper, white pepper and a generous pinch of salt. Cover with cling film and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least 4 hours (12 hours is best if you have time)."},{"Step 3":"Heat the 90ml vegetable oil in a frying pan over a high heat, add the onion and cook for 3 minutes until just starting to soften, then add the marinated venison and cook for 5-6 minutes more. Remove from the heat, scoop out the venison and onion using a slotted spoon, then put in a bowl lined with kitchen paper."},{"Step 4":"For the barbecue sauce, heat a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the onion, ginger, shallot and spring onions, then cook for 4-5 minutes until golden. Remove from the heat. Mix both soy sauces, oyster sauce and 250ml water in a jug, then pour into the pan, return to the heat and bring to the boil. Bubble to reduce by about a third, then stir in the 115g sugar."},{"Step 5":"Add the venison to the sauce and simmer for 4-5 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the cornflour and potato starch with 65ml cold water to form a paste. Slowly pour the starch mixture into the sauce, stirring all the time, until thick and glossy, then remove from the heat, season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool (see Make Ahead).<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-35534\" src=\"https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/A-glossy-venison-stew.jpg\" alt=\"glossy venison stew\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/A-glossy-venison-stew.jpg 600w, https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/A-glossy-venison-stew-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/A-glossy-venison-stew-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/A-glossy-venison-stew-100x100.jpg 100w, https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/A-glossy-venison-stew-25x25.jpg 25w, https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/A-glossy-venison-stew-54x54.jpg 54w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" />"},{"Step 6":"To make the basic dough, mix the 325g flour, custard powder (see food team’s tips), caster sugar and vegetable oil in a large bowl, then pour in 125ml cold water.
