Halve, deseed and slice the chilli into similar-size strips. Put them both in iced water, then set aside."},{"Step 2":"Put the prawns in a food processor with the kimchi and soy sauce. Pulse to a rough paste, then pulse in the egg white (or do this by hand, chopping it all together on a board, then mixing in a bowl)."},{"Step 3":"Divide the mixture equally among the 6 slices of bread and spread as close to the edges as possible. Cut each piece diagonally into 4 triangles. Sprinkle over the sesame seeds and press them on with your fingers."},{"Step 4":"Pour enough oil into a large frying pan or wide saucepan to fill to about 2cm deep. Put on a medium heat. When the oil is hot enough to sizzle when a small cube of bread is added and turns it golden in 30-40 seconds, you’re ready to fry. Gently lower in the prawn toasts in batches, bread-side down, then fry for 3 minutes or until golden. Carefully turn over and cook prawn-side down for 2 minutes more or until brown and cooked through. Transfer to kitchen paper to drain."},{"Step 5":"Drain the spring onions and chilli and pat dry on kitchen paper, then toss with the coriander.
