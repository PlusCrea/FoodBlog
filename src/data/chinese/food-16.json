Set aside for 30 minutes (see tip)."},{"Step 2":"In one of the woks or pans, heat the oil to about 170°C on a digital probe thermometer (a cube of bread should turn golden in about 40 seconds). Drop the apple wedges into the batter and turn to coat. Using a slotted spoon, lift out a few pieces of apple at a time and let any excess batter drop off. Lower into the hot oil and fry for about 2 minutes until golden. Transfer to the prepared tray using a slotted spoon. Keep warm."},{"Step 3":"Fill a bowl with iced water. For the caramel coating, heat the sugar and 2 tablespoons oil in the other wok or pan until the sugar begins to caramelise and turn lightly golden (take care it doesn’t burn). Add the sesame seeds and, once the caramel turns light brown, stir in the apple to coat. Remove with a slotted spoon to the bowl of iced water to harden. Transfer to a platter to serve (see Make Ahead)."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/chinese_recipes_api/16.jpg"}
