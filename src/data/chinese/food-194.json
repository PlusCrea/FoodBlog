{"id":"194","title":"Congee with egg and greens","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"Serves 2","time":"Ready in 45 minutes","description":"A Chinese soup recipe made with rice, egg and fresh salad leaves.","ingredients":["4 spring onions","75g watercress, mustard leaf, rocket or mizuna (or your favourite leaves)","2 tbsp vegetable oil","2.5cm piece root ginger, finely grated","2 garlic cloves, finely chopped","200g risotto rice","100ml rice wine or sherry","2 tbsp soy sauce","1 tsp rice wine vinegar (any wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar will do)","1 litre fresh vegetable stock, hot","2 free-range eggs","Pinch of dried chilli flakes (optional)"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Finely slice the spring onions, keeping the white and green parts apart. Combine the green bits with the salad leaves in a bowl and set aside."},{"Step 2":"Heat the oil gently in a saucepan. When hot, add the onion whites, ginger and garlic and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes. Add the rice, stir, then add the wine or sherry and bubble for a minute or so. Add the soy, vinegar and stock and simmer, stirring occasionally, for at least 30 minutes. The rice should be almost falling apart to make a thick soup-like dish. Keep it thick or add more stock, seasoning as you go (balance salty soy with the vinegarâ€™s sharpness)."},{"Step 3":"Poach the eggs, then place 1 in each soup with a pinch of dried chilli. (Roast duck or pork slices would be good, too.)"}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/chinese_recipes_api/194.jpg"}
