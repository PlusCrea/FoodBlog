Cut the peppers lengthways into rough quarters, discarding any seeds and pith, but leaving the stalks on. Lay them on baking trays skin-side up. Scatter the peppers with the garlic, olive oil, salt, oregano and sherry or balsamic vinegar, and cover with foil. Roast for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and return to the oven for another 15 minutes, or until wilted – their skins should be brown and wrinkly. (Leave the oven on to roast the nuts.) Set aside for at least 15 minutes."},{"Step 2":"Meanwhile, spread the hazelnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and cook in the oven for 5 minutes until golden. Remove and cool slightly, then roughly crush in a pestle and mortar. Transfer the peppers, garlic and the juices to a serving bowl, then scatter the lightly crushed nuts over the top. Squeeze the garlic out of its skin with your fingers as you eat the salad."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/374.jpg"}
