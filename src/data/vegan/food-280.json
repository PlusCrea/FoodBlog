Roughly tear the radicchio into the bowl."},{"Step 2":"In a small frying pan, toast the pine nuts for 2-3 minutes until very lightly golden over a low-medium heat, tossing often – keep an eye on them as they burn very easily. Remove from the pan and set aside."},{"Step 3":"Halve the remaining orange and mix the finely grated zest of one half and its juice with the lemon juice and zest, chopped dill and mustard.
