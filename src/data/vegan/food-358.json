{"id":"358","title":"Jersey royal potatoes and wild mushrooms","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"Serves 8","time":"Ready in 25 minutes","description":"Full-of-flavour wild mushrooms and Jersey royal potatoes get very well acquainted in this healthy side dish or light veggie supper recipe.","ingredients":["400-500g jersey royals, as wee as possible and scrubbed, not peeled","4 tbsp rapeseed or mustard oil (or a mild olive oil for cooking)","2 garlic cloves, sliced","1 red chilli, sliced (deseeded, if you like)","100g wild mushrooms, cleaned, and sliced if large","Juice of 1 lime","Bunch of fresh chives and bunch of fresh dill, roughly chopped"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Boil the potatoes in plenty of salted water for 8-12 minutes (the larger they are, the longer you should cook them), or until just tender. Drain and cool thoroughly, then slice in half lengthways. Set aside."},{"Step 2":"Put the oil in a large pan or wok over a high heat. When really hot, add the garlic, chilli and mushrooms. Fry briskly (think stir-fry) until they start to crisp a little and catch – it will only take 2 minutes, tops. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside."},{"Step 3":"Add the potatoes to the hot wok and fry just as fast for 3-4 minutes, so that they catch a tiny bit too. Take the wok off the heat and stir through the mushrooms. Add the lime juice and all the herbs. It’s important that the herbs wilt – they sweeten up slightly that way. Season to taste and serve warm, if possible."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/358.jpg"}
