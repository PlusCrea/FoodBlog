Cook for 20-25 minutes until the potatoes are tender but not falling apart, then drain well."},{"Step 2":"Meanwhile, roughly chop the capers on a board. Add the parsley leaves and continue chopping. Finally add the garlic and continue to chop until you have an almost paste-like mixture. Transfer to a bowl and add the lemon zest, then set aside (see Make Ahead)."},{"Step 3":"Put the potatoes on a flat surface. Using something flat, such as a plate or the bottom of a pan, gently squash the potatoes. Don’t completely crush them – you want them to mostly hold their shape."},{"Step 4":"Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, add the potatoes to the hot oil and fry for around 10 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden and crunchy. Scatter over the parsley mixture and gently move the potatoes around so they’re coated and the capers become a little crispy. Serve (see tip)."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/110.jpg"}
