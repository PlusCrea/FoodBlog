This would also work well with chopped peanuts or hazelnuts.","ingredients":["6 small bananas, called bananitos or apple-bananas","200g caster sugar","50g shelled pistachios, chopped"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Peel the bananas and push a wooden lolly stick lengthways into each one."},{"Step 2":"To make the caramel, put the caster sugar in a medium, deep saucepan with 4 tablespoons of water and heat gently, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Raise the heat and bubble rapidly to make a clear, golden caramel. Immediately remove the pan from the heat and allow the bubbles to subside."},{"Step 3":"Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with non-stick baking paper. Taking each banana, hold the tip of the stick and carefully dip the banana in the caramel â€“ tilt the pan to get a good coating. Hold each over a plate in case it drips, and scatter with some chopped pistachios. Set aside on the baking sheet to set briefly. Eat within 1 hour, before the caramel becomes too sticky."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/381.jpg"}
