{"id":"328","title":"Mushroom duxelles","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"for 4 people","time":"Ready in about 35 minutes","description":"The mushroom paste in this vegetarian starter can also be used as an ingredient in the ultimate 1970’s dinner party recipe (which is now making a comeback) – beef wellington.","ingredients":["1 tbsp mild olive oil","300g large black field mushrooms (aka horse or Portobello mushrooms),","cleaned and finely diced","1 shallot, finely diced","Small bunch of fresh tarragon, finely chopped","4 thick slices good-quality white bread (if serving as a starter)"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Heat the oil in a frying pan over a gentle heat, then add the mushrooms, shallot and tarragon. You need to sauté gently, until all the moisture from the mushrooms has evaporated. This will take about 25 minutes, depending on the width of your pan. The best way to test that it’s ready is to trail a wooden spoon through the middle of the pan. If juices appear in its wake, keep cooking for 5 minutes and try it again. The spoon should leave a clear path behind it."},{"Step 2":" Preheat the grill to high. Use a biscuit cutter to cut the bread slices into little circles, toast on both sides under the grill and top with spoonfuls of the mushroom duxelle mixture before serving."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/328.jpg"}
