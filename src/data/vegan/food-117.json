Put each type of vegetable in its own bowl to keep them separate. Add a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt to each bowl and stir gently to coat."},{"Step 2":"Heat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4. Arrange the vegetable slices in a single layer separately on the prepared sheets – they’ll cook at different rates, so you’ll need to do this in batches. Bake for 20 minutes, checking halfway through. Turn those that are starting to brown, then continue to bake until the crisps are lightly golden and crispy – take out those that cook more quickly as you go, then add a new batch to the oven. Once the crisps are cooked, cool on a wire rack."},{"Step 3":"Meanwhile, lightly toast the fennel seeds in a small dry pan for 2 minutes or until they start to brown. Cool, then grind in a pestle and mortar or spice grinder. Combine with the salt and lime zest. Transfer the cooled crisps to a large bowl, sprinkle over fennel salt to taste, then toss gently to combine. Serve with our whisky Aperol hot toddy, if you fancy."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/117.jpg"}
