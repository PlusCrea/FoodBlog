Chef Rohit Ghai shares his aromatic masala recipe for four.","ingredients":["500g unripe jackfruit (see Know How)","2 tbsp rapeseed oil","250g onions, chopped","1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste (see Easy Swaps)","¼ tsp ground turmeric","1 tsp red chilli powder","½ tsp kashmiri chilli powder (or mild chilli powder/paprika)","1 tsp amchur (dried mango powder)","1 tbsp ground coriander","150g (2-3) tomatoes, chopped","1 green chilli, deseeded and chopped","1 tbsp chopped fresh ginger","1 tsp garam masala","Handful coriander leaves"],"method":[{"Step 1":"If using tinned jackfruit, wash it under running cold water and leave it in a colander to drain. If you’re using raw whole jackfruit, first grease your fingers well with vegetable or rapeseed oil,or mustard oil if you have it – the oil prevents the jackfruit fibres from sticking to your hand. Place a bowl of oil next to you while cutting the jackfruit, as you’ll need to smear your palms with oil from time to time. With a sharp knife, remove the skin of the jackfruit and cut out any thick stem in the centre. Cut the jackfruit flesh into small pieces – don’t wash it."},{"Step 2":"Heat the oil in a kadai or frying pan over a medium heat. Once it starts smoking, add the jackfruit in small batches and shallow-fry until light brown. Remove from the pan, then put in a colander and set aside."},{"Step 3":"Add the onions to the pan and fry until golden brown (about 10 minutes). Add the ginger-garlic paste and cook for 4-5 minutes until the raw aroma disappears, then add the turmeric, red chilli powder, kashmiri/mild chilli powder/paprika, dried mango powder, ground coriander and a pinch of salt. Add the tomatoes, green chilli and ginger and cook until the oil separates from the mixture. This usually takes 5-10 minutes over a low heat."},{"Step 4":"Add the jackfruit and stir to coat the pieces evenly with the spice mix. Cover with a lid and let the mixture cook over a low heat for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. During this time the jackfruit pieces will absorb the flavour of the spices and the sauce should become dry. Sprinkle with the garam masala and scatter over the coriander leaves to serve."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/70.jpg"}
