Drizzle the aubergines with oil and barbecue skin-side down for 10 minutes until tender. Flip, then brush the flesh side with most of the glaze.

Set aside on a plate and brush with the remaining glaze."},{"Step 2":"Meanwhile, for the tabbouleh, follow the pack instructions to cook the quinoa, then rinse and drain well. Put the olive oil, lemon juice (setting aside a squeeze for the dressing) and garlic in a large bowl and whisk to combine, then add the tomatoes, courgette, mint and quinoa. Season and mix."},{"Step 3":"Stir the remaining squeeze of lemon into the tahini, then gradually whisk in the water to make a smooth sauce. Divide the quinoa among plates, top each with an aubergine half and drizzle with dressing to serve."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/43.jpg"}
