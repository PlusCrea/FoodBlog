{"id":"71","title":"Vegan chocolate chip oat bars","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"Makes 12 bars","time":"Hands-on time 15 min, plus oven time 40-55 min","description":"These better-for-you vegan bars are made with roasted pumpkin, oats and dark choc chips. Cut into slices ready for lunchboxes and snacks.","ingredients":["420g pumpkin or squash (peeled and de-seeded weight), cut into 2cm cubes","1 tsp sunflower oil","100g dairy-free spread (such as Pure) or coconut oil","50g light soft brown sugar","75g soft dates, roughly chopped (stoned weight; medjool or Persian dates give the best stickiest results)","175g jumbo oats","90g plain wholemeal flour (we used spelt)","½ tsp baking powder","90g nuts (we used almonds), roughly chopped","60g dark chocolate chunks (at least 70% cocoa solids)","30g cocoa nibs"," 20cm x 20cm square baking tin, greased and base-lined"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Heat the oven to 180ºC fan/gas 6. Spread the squash in a roasting tin, toss with the sunflower oil and roast for 20-25 minutes until softened and golden. Set aside and reduce the oven to 160ºC fan/gas 4."},{"Step 2":"Meanwhile, melt the spread/oil and sugar with the dates in a small pan over a low heat. Remove from the heat. Add the roasted squash while still hot, then blend until smooth with a stick blender/food processor."},{"Step 3":"Mix the oats, flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Add the roasted squash mixture, then mix using a table knife (as you’d mix scones), being careful not to overwork the mixture. When almost combined, stir in the nuts, chocolate chunks and cocoa nibs. Transfer the mixture to the prepared tin, pushing it into the corners to evenly distribute, but be gentle – try not to press it down and flatten the top too much. Bake for 30-40 minutes until golden on top. Leave to cool completely, then cut into 12 fingers."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/71.jpg"}
