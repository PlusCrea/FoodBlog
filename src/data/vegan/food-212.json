Best doused in plenty of salt and vinegar, you won’t go far wrong with this crispy treat.","ingredients":["800g floury potatoes (we used maris piper)","2 litres sunflower oil","Malt vinegar and sea salt flakes to serve","Digital probe thermometer or a deep-fat fryer"],"method":[{"Step 1":" Peel the potatoes and chop into finger-size chips (any length will do). "},{"Step 2":"Fill a large deep-sided saucepan 8-10cm deep (no more than halfway) with the sunflower oil and heat until the oil reaches 140°C on a digital probe thermometer (a raw chip will sizzle and float to the top – or use a deep-fat fryer). Once the oil is up to temperature, use a large slotted spoon (or frying basket) to add half the chips to the pan, then fry for 7-8 minutes until tender but not coloured. Remove with a slotted spoon to a baking tray and repeat with the remaining chips. Leave to cool completely."},{"Step 3":"Increase the oil temperature to 180°C (or when a piece of bread browns in about 30 seconds). Add half the chips to the pan/fryer and cook for 3-4 minutes until golden and crisp. Remove to a bowl lined with kitchen paper to drain, then repeat with the remaining chips. Drizzle with plenty of vinegar and toss with sea salt to serve."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/212.jpg"}
