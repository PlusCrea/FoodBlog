Not least as there is plenty of margin for error. You still get that crispy, crunchy texture in this version as well as a hit of freshness from the lemon.” – Steffi Knowles-Dellner","ingredients":["1.3-1.5kg floury potatoes such as maris piper, peeled","50ml olive oil","3 garlic cloves, very finely chopped","Grated zest and juice 1½ lemons","1 tsp dried thyme","1 tsp dried oregano","2 fresh thyme sprigs, leaves picked","Large oven dish with high sides, about 35cm x 20cm"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Begin by thinly slicing the potatoes about 0.25cm thick. The easiest way to do this is to use a mandoline or the slicing attachment on a food processor. If you’re doing it by hand, make sure you have the radio on and a comfortable seat as it will take a while. Put the slices in a large bowl of cold water as you go."},{"Step 2":"Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Drain the potatoes and pat dry on kitchen paper. Stack the potato slices upright in lines that run the length of the oven dish. Pack them tightly together so they support each other to form long rows."},{"Step 3":"Mix the olive oil, garlic, lemon zest and juice with the dried thyme and oregano. Drizzle over the potatoes, then sprinkle with sea salt and the fresh thyme leaves."},{"Step 4":"Bake for 60-70 minutes until crisp and golden (cover with foil if they start going too brown). Test that the centres of the potato slices are soft and cooked through with a skewer before removing from the oven."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/221.jpg"}
