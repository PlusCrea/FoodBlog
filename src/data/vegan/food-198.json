{"id":"198","title":"Miso and maple aubergine ‘steak’ burger","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"Serves 2","time":"Hands-on time 25 min, oven time 20 min","description":"A quick miso marinade gives an umami-rich flavour to aubergine ‘steaks’ to replace traditional beef in this meat-free burger – and it happens to be vegan.","ingredients":["2 tbsp white miso paste (from Waitrose, Ocado and Amazon)","1 tbsp maple syrup","1 tbsp dark soy sauce","1 large aubergine","2 medium onions, cut into wedges","2 tbsp vegan mayonnaise","Grated zest and juice ½ lime","1 tbsp sriracha sauce","2 burger buns, split in half","Salad (we used an Asian herb/salad mix but you could use a combination of coriander and pea shoots) and a few salted peanuts (optional) to serve"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Heat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4. Mix the miso paste, maple syrup and soy in a shallow bowl to make a marinade. Slice the aubergine lengthways into 3cm-thick strips (you’ll have leftovers – see tips) and coat thoroughly in the marinade."},{"Step 2":"Heat a griddle pan over a medium-high heat. Toss the onions in a little oil, then griddle for 3 minutes on each side. Put on a large baking sheet, then transfer to the oven to cook for 20 minutes while you char the aubergine slices."},{"Step 3":"Turn the heat under the griddle pan to medium, then griddle the aubergine slices for 5 minutes on each side. Add to the tray with the onions for the last 10 minutes, so they’re cooked through and tender."},{"Step 4":"Meanwhile, mix the mayonnaise and half the lime zest. If you like, warm the burger buns in the oven. Spread a little of the mayo mixture on the bottom half of each bun, drizzle with sriracha, then top with the aubergine steaks, onions, salad and peanuts (if using). Finish the burger with a squeeze of lime juice and the top half of the bun (see tips)."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/198.jpg"}
