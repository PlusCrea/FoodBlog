Leave the bowl in a warm place for a few minutes until frothy."},{"Step 2":"Put the remaining flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre, pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil and combine to form a soft dough. Knead for 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel and set aside for 30 minutes."},{"Step 3":"Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and shape each into a ball. Flour the work surface, take a ball and flatten it with your hands to form a round. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough to form a thin round about 20cm across. Scatter with a little za’atar and roll again to press it into the dough. Set aside on a lightly floured tray while you shape the remaining flatbreads."},{"Step 4":"Heat the frying/griddle pan over a high heat. Cook the flatbreads one at a time, for about 1 minute on each side, until puffed and golden. Wrap in a clean tea towel and keep warm (see Make Ahead) until ready to serve."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/88.jpg"}
