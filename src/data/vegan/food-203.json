Rub the aubergines all over with oil, then put on a baking sheet. Roast, turning every 15 minutes, for 45-60 minutes or until they’ve collapsed and the skin has charred and blackened (see tip)."},{"Step 2":"Remove the aubergines from the oven and set aside until cool enough to handle. Cut them in half, scoop out the flesh (discard the skins) and put into a sieve to drain for 15-20 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, add the remaining ingredients with some salt and pepper, then combine with a fork, gently breaking up the aubergine.
