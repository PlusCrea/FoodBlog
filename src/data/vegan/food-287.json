{"id":"287","title":"Barbecue courgettes with lemon and dukkah","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"Serves 6 as a side","time":"Hands-on time 20 min, barbecue time 20-25 min","description":"Homemade dukkah – a mixture of ground nuts and spices  – adds flavour and crunch to the courgettes in this vegetarian barbecue side dish recipe.","ingredients":["6 medium courgettes","Olive oil for drizzling","2 garlic cloves, finely chopped","50g sesame seeds","25g coriander seeds","5g cumin seeds","50g blanched almonds","Extra-virgin olive oil to drizzle","Finely grated zest and juice","1 large juicy lemon, plus a couple extra to char (optional)"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Put each courgette on a separate piece of foil, rub with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and top each with chopped garlic. Wrap each one into a parcel, then place straight into the embers in the bottom of the barbecue using tongs. Move some of the embers on top of the parcels so they’re covered. The courgettes will take around 20-25 minutes to cook and soften – if you’re making them as part of the menu, put them into the embers once the lamb comes off to rest."},{"Step 2":"While the courgettes are cooking, make the dukkah by toasting all the seeds and almonds in a dry pan until lightly coloured and fragrant. Grind in a pestle and mortar or blender to a coarse crumb, then season well with salt and pepper. Set aside."},{"Step 3":"Use tongs to remove the courgette parcels from the embers, then leave to cool for 5 minutes before opening them up and sprinkling with some lemon zest and a little juice. Serve on their foil wrappers with dukkah scattered over. Have extra dukkah on the side, with charred lemons for squeezing, if you like (see tips)."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/287.jpg"}
