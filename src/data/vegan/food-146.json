Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Pour into a heatproof glass or ceramic bowl, then add the baby carrots and cauliflower. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours (see Make Ahead)."},{"Step 2":"Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Put the beetroot chunks ona sheet of foil, drizzle with oil, add salt and pepper, then wrap to seal tightly. Set on one side of a baking tray. Repeat with the carrot chunks, wrapping in the same way, and put on the other side of the baking tray. Roast for 30 minutes, then open the carrot parcel and set aside to cool. Return the beetroot parcel to the oven for a further 15-20 minutes until tender."},{"Step 3":"For the carrot houmous, drain 400g chickpeas, reserving the liquid from the tin. Put in a food processor with the roasted carrots, caraway seeds, garlic, tahini and lemon juice. Whizz, then, with the motor running, pour in a little of the reserved chickpea liquid to form a smooth, thick houmous. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then transfer to a bowl. Rinse out the food processor."},{"Step 4":"Repeat the same method with the beetroot houmous ingredients and the pea houmous ingredients, adding just enough liquid each time to reach the desired consistency."},{"Step 5":"To assemble the platter, put the houmous in 3 separate serving bowls, then put on a larger platter, board or tray.
