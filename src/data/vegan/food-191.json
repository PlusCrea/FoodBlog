{"id":"191","title":"Shallot tarte tatin","difficulty":"Medium","portion":"Serves 4","time":"Hands-on time 20 min, oven time 25-30 min, plus chilling","description":"You won’t believe that Gaz Oakley’s shallot tarte tatin is vegan. Sweet shallots are caramelised in brown sugar, balsamic vinegar and brandy until gorgeously sticky. Serve at a dinner party and watch your guests’ jaws drop.","ingredients":["320g vegan puff pastry (we used Jus-Rol)","Plain flour for dusting","4 tbsp rapeseed oil","5-6 banana shallots, peeled, cut in half lengthways and roots trimmed","3 tbsp soft light brown sugar","4 tbsp balsamic vinegar","2 tbsp vegan brandy (optional; see Vegan Drinks Cupboard)","2 fresh thyme sprigs","1 fresh rosemary sprig","½ tsp sea salt flakes","½ tsp cracked black pepper","25cm non-stick ovenproof, heavy-based frying pan (measured across the top)"],"method":[{"Step 1":" Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to around 4mm thick, then cut it into a circle measuring about 2.5cm larger in diameter than your pan (about 27.5cm). Transfer the pastry circle to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper, then cover and chill until needed (at least 20 minutes)."},{"Step 2":"Heat the oven to 170°C/150°C fan/gas 3½. Heat the pan over a mediumheat with 3 tbsp of the oil. Add the shallots, cut-side up, making sure you have enough to cover the base. Cook for 3-4 minutes, then sprinkle over the brownsugar. Flip over the shallots using a palette knife – arrange them neatly so the base is covered and there aren’t any gaps."},{"Step 3":"Turn down the heat to low, then add the balsamic vinegar and brandy, if using. (The alcohol will mostly cook off, leaving behind the brandy flavour.) Add the leaves from one sprig of thyme and the rosemary, and let the shallots caramelise for 4-5 minutes. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper, then turn off the heat and drizzle over the remaining oil (see Make Ahead)."},{"Step 4":"Carefully lift the chilled pastry and lay it over the pan. Using a wooden spoon so you don’t have to touch the hot metal, quickly and carefully tuck the pastry over the shallots and right into the edges of the pan. Bake the tarte tatin in the oven for 25-30 minutes or until the pastry is lovely and golden."},{"Step 5":"Once cooked, remove the tart from the oven and leave it to coolfor 2-3 minutes. Set a board or plate upside-down on top of the pan (make sure it’s larger than the pan!). Wear an oven glove to protect the arm holding the board (some caramel goodness may drip out and it’s super hot), then quickly, carefully and confidently flip the pan and board/plate to turn out the tarte."},{"Step 6":"Serve straightaway, sprinkled with the remaining fresh thyme."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/191.jpg"}
