{"id":"28","title":"Runner bean and apple chutney","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"Makes about 1.5-1.75 litres","time":"Hands-on time 15 min","description":"Transform a glut of late summer veg into Gill Meller’s runner bean and apple chutney. This tangy pickle will last you well into winter. Root, Stem, Leaf, Flower by Gill Meller is out now (£27, Hardie Grant).","ingredients":["500g runner beans, de-stringed and cut into 1cm lengths","1kg bramley apples, peeled, quartered, cored and roughly chopped","500g ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped","2 onions, roughly chopped","150g sultanas","2 tsp coriander seeds, bashed","1 tsp caraway seeds, bashed","2 green cardamom pods, bashed","350g light brown soft sugar","500ml cider vinegar","1 tsp fine sea salt","Preserving pan or large non-reactive saucepan; sterilised preserving jars","Pestle and mortar for bashing"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Put all the ingredients in a preserving pan over a medium heat (see Easy Swaps). Slowly bring the mixture up to a simmer, stirring regularly until the sugar has dissolved."},{"Step 2":"Reduce the heat and gently simmer the chutney for 1½–2 hours, stirring every so often to stop it sticking to the base of the pan. The chutney will thicken as it cooks; you’ll know it’s ready when you can draw a wooden spoon across the bottom of the pan and it leaves a path behind it for a few seconds before the chutney collapses back down and covers the base. Be extra-careful it doesn’t catch and burn at this point."},{"Step 3":"Remove the chutney from the heat and spoon carefully into jars, still warm from sterilising (see Know-how). Seal with the lids and cool. Store in a cool, dark place for several months before eating – although you can eat it earlier, if you like. Once open, store in the fridge and use within a month."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/28.jpg"}
