Simmer over a high heat until reduced by half, this will take about 10-15 minutes.

Pour over the spiced oil and vinegar mixture, seal the jar and give a good shake. It may not seem like enough liquid but the mushrooms let out a lot of water, you will notice this after 24 hours. They’ll be ready to use within 1 week but flavour improves with age. Refrigerate. Use within 3 months."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/262.jpg"}
