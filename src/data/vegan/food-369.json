Unless you’ve picked them yourself, they will taste a little starchy when raw – I blanch them in water at a rolling boil for no more than 30 seconds, then set aside on kitchen paper to soak up the excess moisture."},{"Step 2":"While they rest, prepare the avocados. Halve lengthways and remove the stones. Using a small knife – a paring or fruit knife is ideal – cut criss-cross shapes through the flesh, stopping just short of the skin. Now you can simply peel the avocado over the salad bowl and let the pieces fall in."},{"Step 3":"Mix the lemon juice with the oil and mustard and dress the avocado pieces immediately. When ready to eat, add the other ingredients and toss lightly. Season to taste and serve."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/369.jpg"}
