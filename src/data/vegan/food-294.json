Add the maple syrup and vanilla to the melted coconut oil and stir well."},{"Step 3":"Pour the coconut oil mixture over the dry ingredients, then work well with your Hands, lifting and mixing until all ingredients are covered in a light sheen. Taste and add more maple syrup if needed."},{"Step 4":"Line 4 baking sheets with baking paper, then divide the granola among them in a single layer (or use two baking sheets and work in batches). It’s important the granola isn’t too crowded when it goes into the oven."},{"Step 5":"Bake for 15 minutes, giving the granola a gentle stir halfway through. Keep an eye on it from around the 10 minute mark to prevent burning."},{"Step 6":"Remove the baking sheets from the oven and set aside for the granola to cool completely.
