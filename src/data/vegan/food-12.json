These mini ones are lightly spiced, just begging to be dipped into mayo or ketchup. Great for a party.","ingredients":["600g new potatoes","2 tbsp rapeseed oil","1 tbsp cornflour","1 tsp sea salt","1 tsp smoked paprika","½ tsp garlic powder","1 tsp freshly ground black pepper","Ketchup, mayo or your dipping sauce of choice to serve"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Quarter each potato lengthways, trying to keep each wedge an equal size (so any smaller potatoes might only need to be halved). Put the wedges in a bowl of cold water as you work, swishing the water around them to remove excess starch. Drain well and pat dry."},{"Step 2":"Mix the remaining ingredients together to make a loose paste, then spoon over the wedges. Give everything a toss to coat evenly, then set aside for 5 minutes."},{"Step 3":"Heat the air fryer to 200°C. Put the wedges in the air fryer basket, ideally in a single layer with room around each one for ultimate crispiness. Cook for 18-20 minutes, giving them a shake halfway. Serve with plenty of sauce for dipping."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/12.jpg"}
