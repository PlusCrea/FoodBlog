{"id":"67","title":"Preserved lemons","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"Makes 1 large/a few smaller jars ","time":"Hands-on time 10 min, plus 4-5 weeks fermenting","description":"With only two basic ingredients and some imaginative flavourings, preserved lemons are storecupboard stars. Make a jar or two with our easy recipe.","ingredients":["12 small unwaxed lemons (about 1kg; see tips)","200g pure salt","8-10 mixed peppercorns","2 fresh bay leaves","1 chilli, halved (optional)","1 large jar (around 1.5 litres) or a few smaller jars, washed and sterilised"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Juice 4 of the lemons and set the juice aside. Cut the rest of the lemons lengthways into quarters, stopping three quarters of the way through so the wedges are still attached at one end."},{"Step 2":"Sprinkle about 2 tsp salt onto the cut sides of each lemon, then layer in the jar(s) with the peppercorns, bay, chilli (if using) and any remaining salt. Press the lemons to help them release their juice, then pour in the reserved juice to cover. (If necessary, top up with filtered or boiled-and-cooled water to ensure the lemons are fully covered.)"},{"Step 3":"Close the jar and set aside for 4-5 weeks in a cool spot, away from direct sunlight. Invert the jar every day for the first week or so to make sure the brine is evenly dispersed. The sealed jar(s) will keep for several months. Chill once opened and use within a couple of months."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/67.jpg"}
