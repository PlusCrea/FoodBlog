{"id":"34","title":"Pide dough","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"Makes 3 x 150g dough balls","time":"Hands-on time 15 min, plus about 3 hours resting and rising","description":"Josh Katz’s pide dough recipe makes three balls of springy dough. Use the dough to make pide (Turkish-style oval pizzas), pizzas or flatbreads.","ingredients":["5g fresh yeast","35ml warm (26-29°C) water","½ tsp runny honey","175g strong bread flour","125g ‘00’ flour","3g fine salt","½ tbsp olive oil, plus extra to grease","135ml ice-cold water","Stand mixer with dough hook"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Combine the yeast, warm water and honey in a bowl and whisk to dissolve the yeast. Set aside for 10 minutes to give the yeast time to activate. The mixture should start to bubble and foam – if it doesn’t, discard the yeast and start again with a different batch."},{"Step 2":"Put the flours in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, add the salt, oil and cold water. Run the mixer on its lowest speed for about 1 minute, then add the yeast mixture and mix for 5-7 minutes until the dough comes together as a smooth mass (it should be soft but not sticky). If the dough feels too sticky, add a little more flour and continue to mix. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth and rest for 1-1½ hours or until the dough has roughly doubled in size."},{"Step 3":"Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 2-3 minutes, then form into 3 equal balls weighing 150-160g. Transfer the balls to a lightly oiled tray, arranging them roughly 5-7cm apart. Double-wrap loosely with cling film and leave to rise for 1-2 hours, or until the balls have roughly doubled in size (see Make Ahead). The dough is now ready to shape as a base for pides, flatbreads or pizzas."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/34.jpg"}
