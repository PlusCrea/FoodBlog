It’s traditionally served with manchego cheese, but also delightful spread on toast.","ingredients":["1kg quinces (4-5), washed to remove any fuzz, then cored and quartered","7 tbsp lemon juice","800g caster sugar","Fine sieve lined with 2-3 layers of muslin","Blender or food processor","20cm x 20cm tin lined with compostable baking paper"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Put the quinces, lemon juice and 1 litre cold water in a large pan (one with a lid). Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Put on the lid and cook for 45-50 minutes until the quinces are very soft. Strain the fruit through a fine muslin lined sieve (see Don’t Waste It)."},{"Step 2":"Whizz the strained quinces to a fine purée in a blender or food processor. Pour into a large pan and stir in the sugar. Put the pan over a low-medium heat and cook, stirring regularly to make sure it doesn’t catch on the bottom, for 40-50 minutes until reduced and thickened. The quince paste is done when it doesn’t fall back on itself when stirred"},{"Step 3":"Spread the quince paste inside the prepared tin. Smooth the surface, then press a sheet of compostable baking paper over the top. Leave to cool and set for at least 24 hours. Cut into 2.5cm x 2.5cm squares to serve."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/85.jpg"}
