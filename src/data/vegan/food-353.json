{"id":"353","title":"Warm cauliflower salad","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"Serves 2","time":"Ready in 25 minutes","description":"This warm Sicilian-style cauliflower salad recipe is made with raisins, pine nuts and saffron. Serve with grilled fish or meat.","ingredients":["1 medium cauliflower, leaves discarded, broken into small florets","Generous pinch of saffron","75ml olive oil or rapeseed oil","1 large red onion, thinly sliced","50g pine nuts","50g raisins","Extra-virgin olive oil, to dress","Small handful chopped fresh mint","Small handful chopped fresh flatleaf parsley"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Heat a saucepan filled with a generous amount of salted water and, when it comes to a rolling boil, pop in the cauliflower and saffron. Cook for just 2-3 minutes, so that the cauliflower picks up a little colour from the saffron but stays very much al dente. Drain well and spread on a tray to cool quickly."},{"Step 2":"Meanwhile, put the oil in a frying pan over a high heat. When it’s just starting to show wisps of smoke, add the onion. Fry briskly for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they start to look crispy and caramelised. Add the pine nuts and raisins. Stir and cook for just a couple of minutes (the raisins will swell and the pine nuts should colour a little). Tip into a sieve to drain off the excess oil and transfer to a large bowl."},{"Step 3":"To serve, toss the cauliflower with the onions, nuts and raisins and season to taste. Drizzle generously with extra-virgin olive oil and scatter with the herbs. Some people like to serve this with shavings of a sheep’s cheese (Pecorino is perfect)."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/353.jpg"}
