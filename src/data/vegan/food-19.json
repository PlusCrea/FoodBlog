{"id":"19","title":"Marmite parsnips with poppy seeds","difficulty":"Easy","portion":"Serves 4-6 as a side","time":"Hands-on time 5 min. Oven time 45 min","description":"Marmite’s deeply savoury flavour mellows out into something sweeter and almost smoky once heated, making it the perfect match for roast parsnips.","ingredients":["6 parsnips","1 tbsp vegetable oil","1 tbsp marmite","1 tbsp poppy seeds"],"method":[{"Step 1":"Heat the oven to 160°C fan/gas 4. Trim the tops of the parsnips then give them a good scrub under running water. Cut them lengthways into quarters (or sixths if they’re particularly big) and put them on a baking tray. Mix the oil with the marmite to loosen it slightly, then massage the mixture onto the wedges as evenly as possible."},{"Step 2":"Cook for 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes or so as the marmite can catch and burn (although a little charring and blackening is a good thing). Season with salt and pepper, then sprinkle over the poppy seeds."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/19.jpg"}
