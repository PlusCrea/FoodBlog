Cut the squash into 3cm chunks and toss in a large roasting tin with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch each of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Roast for 25-30 minutes until tender and lightly charred. Set aside to cool."},{"Step 2":"Meanwhile, toss the mushrooms with a drizzle of olive oil in a separate roasting tin and roast alongside the squash for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and stir in the walnuts, chestnuts, chopped parsley stalks, thyme leaves, miso paste (see Know-How) and garlic. Roast for a further 5 minutes. Set aside to cool."},{"Step 3":"In a large bowl, microwave the prunes with the madeira on high for 15-30 seconds until the prunes have soaked up the liquid. Leave to cool."},{"Step 4":"Once the veg have cooled, add to the bowl of chopped prunes with the chopped parsley leaves, chives, soy sauce and panko crumbs, then mix gently (see Tips)."},{"Step 5":"Meanwhile, to make the pastry base, roll out one third of the pastry block on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle roughly 16cm x 25cm. Put on a baking sheet lined with non-stick baking paper, then lightly score a 2cm border around the edge. Score the pastry in a criss-cross pattern within the border, chill for 30 minutes, then bake for 12-15 minutes until golden and puffed. Gently press down the centre if it puffs up too much (see Tips)."},{"Step 6":"Roll out the remaining pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 24cm x 35cm rectangle (this will form the top). Spoon the vegetable filling onto the centre of the baked pastry base and shape into a thick cylinder within the 2cm border. Brush the edges of the pastry base with a little oil, then drape the uncooked pastry rectangle over the top of the filling, tucking in the edges underneathand making sure there are no air bubbles by smoothing it down gently with your hands. Brush with oil, then chill for 30 minutes."},{"Step 7":"Mix a splash more oil with a dash of soy sauce, then brush over the pastry. Sprinkle with sea salt flakes, freshly ground black pepper and poppy seeds, then bake for 30-40 minutes until golden and puffed and the filling is hot. The wellington will keep warm for 30 minutes or so."}],"image":"https://apipics.s3.amazonaws.com/vegan_api/197.jpg"}
